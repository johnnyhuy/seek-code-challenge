# Progress

Hey guys, I'll be braindumping my thoughts and opinions on the process here as I work on the mini-project.

## Docker

Setup Docker Compose stack to ensure I can replicate the setup locally.

Looked up PostgreSQL supported version on AWS before setting it up locally.

If we can't replicate the stack locally, what's the point? Container stacks should be developer friendly, not robot friendly

## OpenJDK or Oracle JDK?

I went with the open source approach but I lack a fair amount of Java knowledge given that I come from a Microsoft shop company.
