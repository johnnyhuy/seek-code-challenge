Hey guys, I'll be braindumping my thoughts and opinions on the process here as I work on the mini-project.

- Setup Docker Compose stack to ensure I can replicate the setup locally
- Looked up PostgreSQL supported version on AWS before setting it up locally
- If we can't replicate the stack locally, what's the point? Container stacks should be developer friendly, not robot friendly
